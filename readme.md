2. Sort expenses by amount, regardless of date. *not gonna do this anymore. this was a bad idea*
3. Weekly target expenditure.
4. Monthly target expenditure. *v1 done*
5. Bug in remove expense. *Update* Bug removed. However find a better and more optimized way to remove expenses.
6. Refactor code in expenseList.js componentDidUpdate and componentWillMount. It's basically the same code, move it out to a separate function.
7. Only current month's expenses on dashboard.
8. Move previous expenses to history. Figure out how to display this.
